## Frank's Notes
1. The phonetic aligment (&transcription) is using [ARPABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET), with alphabet (combination)s marking sounds and numbers noting stress. 

2. We can just leave the structure of the dataset as it is after cutting. Since it will just change the path of files, it won't really affect the reading efficiency during training.
